","From 1912 to 1948, the Olympic Games held competitions in the fine arts. Medals were given for literature, architecture, sculpture, painting, and music. Naturally, the art created was required to be Olympic-themed. According to the founder of the modern Olympics, Pierre de Fri'dy, the addition of the arts was necessary because the ancient Greeks used to hold art festivals alongside the games. Before the art events were eventually removed, 151 medals were awarded.","The value of pi was first calculated by Budhayana, and he explained the concept of what is known as the Pythagorean Theorem. He discovered this in the 6th century long before the European mathematicians."
"The Greenland shark, is a deep sea shark which is an astounding creature, where using carbon dating technology of its eyelids scientists have uncovered a shark that may be aged between 272 years to 500 years old. Additionally, these sharks only arrive at an age of giving birth at around 100 years. ","Forget Ibuprofen. In the 1830s, when it came to popular medicine, ketchup was all the rage. In 1834, it was sold as a cure for indigestion by an Ohio physician named John Cook. It wasn't popularized as a condiment until the late 19th century. The more you know.","""Four"" is the only number, when written in English, whose spelling contains the same number of letters as the number itself."
"The giant squid is a deep sea squid, where the largest of them recorded is at approximately 13 metres long ! Although far larger is the colosal squid witnessed at around 10 metres although weighs 700kg, compared to the giant squid of 100kg. ","Indigenous civilisations once populated the Amazon forest and created extremely fertile soil known as 'Dark Earth' or Tera Preta. Amazonian Dark Earths (ADEs) are unusually fertile soils characterised by elevated concentrations of microscopic charcoal particles, which confer their distinctive colouration. Frequent occurrences of pre-Columbian artefacts at ADE sites led to their ubiquitous classification as Anthrosols (soils of anthropic origin). However, it remains unclear how indigenous peoples created areas of high fertility in one of the most nutrient-impoverished environments on Earth.","You can cut a cake into 8 equal pieces by using only 3 cuts. The trick here is to not think of a cake as a two-dimensional circle, as most people tend to, but instead as the three-dimensional cylinder,"
"Twilight observations with the Dark Energy Camera at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, a program of the U.S. National Science Foundation-supported NOIRLab, have enabled astronomers to spot three near-Earth asteroids, or NEAs, hiding in the glare of the sun. One is the largest object potentially hazardous to Earth to be discovered in the last eight years. The NEAs are part of an elusive population that lurks inside the orbits of Earth and Venus. One is a 1.5-kilometer-wide asteroid called 2022 AP7, which has an orbit that may someday place it in Earth's path. ","Sanskrit is the mother of all the European languages. Sanskrit is the most suitable language for computer software, reported in Forbes magazine, July 1987.","Multiplying ones will always give you palindromic numbers. 11 x 11 = 121,
111 x 111 = 12321,
1111 x 1111 = 1234321,
and keep going. If you multiply 111111111 x 111111111 you get 12345678987654321."
Researchers at Penn State have successfully 3D bioprinted breast cancer tumors and treated them in a breakthrough study to better understand the disease that is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide.,"Although modern images of India often show poverty and lack of development, India was the richest country on earth until the time of British invasion in the early 17th Century.","There is no zero (0) in Roman numerals. The entire number system is generated by the seven different letters, namely I, V, X, L, C, D and M. Using these, we can write numbers up to 3999."
Smart home devices for instance take a few seconds to respond because these devices retrieve data from data centres stored hundreds of miles away. And then run enormous machine learning models to deduct what the user is asking for. Therefore MIT have introduced a new mechanism from reducing the latency of these devies by switching to a central server where components of the machine learning models are encoded into 'light waves'.  The waves are then transmittted to the device using fibre optics.  This method could allow a self-driving car to make decisions in real time while using less energy. ,This historical fact about Malaysia still blows our minds. Malaysians changed their time zones six times before they settled with a Malaysian standard time (MYT). The most peculiar experience Malaysia had with its time zone was when it was split in two because Sabah and Sarawak were 30 minutes ahead of every other area in the country. ,Forty is the only number that is spelt with letters arranged in alphabetical order.
"A team of University of Minnesota Twin Cities scientists and engineers has developed a first-of-its-kind, plant-inspired process that enables synthetic material growth. The new approach will allow researchers to build better soft robots that can navigate hard-to-reach places, complicated terrain and, potentially, areas within the human body.","Filipinos are known for their generosity, and throughout their country's history, this applied to foreigners in need of help. In the 1930s, then-President Manuel Quezon implemented the Open Door policy which turned Manila into a temporary safe haven for Jewish refugees fleeing from Nazi Germany.

With 127 of the country's volcanoes currently active,"In case you still didn't know, we have Taiwan to thank for bubble tea. This magical concoction emerged in Taiwan in the 1980s, slowly spread all over Asia, and has successfully infiltrated western nations. Bubble tea is also called boba tea or pearl tea, with variations like milk tea and fruit tea served with coconut jelly. What's your favourite flavour?","Teenagers texting in Thailand will send the digits 555 to indicate that something is funny. In the Thai language, 5 is pronounced as ha which when translated becomes ha-ha-ha."
